      Of those, 86% are in the U.S. and Europe. And sorry, Europe <br/>
      actually squeaked past North America by three breweries. <br/>
      Even so, the U.S. has more than 4,000 breweries, <br/>

      <p>"Yuengling is the oldest beer in America and has been around since 1829.<br/>
       It was one of the only early American breweries to survive prohibition <br/>
       because it produced “near bears”, which only had a 0.5% alcohol content."</p>

Yeast (responsible for fermentation; based on style-specific strains) <br/>
Water (accounts for up to 95 percent of beer's content)</p>
